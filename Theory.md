## External Field Effect (EFE) in MOSGM

### 3.1 Conceptual Origin

In the Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM), the External Field Effect (EFE) arises as a natural consequence of spacetime curvature being sourced directly by baryonic matter distributions. Unlike dark-matter–based frameworks, where local dynamics are largely insensitive to weak background fields, MOSGM predicts that the gravitational response of a system depends on the **total spacetime gradient**, including both internal and external baryonic contributions.

The EFE in MOSGM is not an empirical add-on but an emergent property of the non-linear coupling between baryonic matter and spacetime curvature near the critical acceleration scale \( a_0 \).

---

### 3.2 Core Assumptions

The MOSGM formulation of EFE is based on the following assumptions:

1. **Baryonic Exclusivity**  
   Spacetime curvature is sourced solely by baryonic matter density \( \rho_b \). There is no independent dark matter field or halo component.

2. **Non-linearity near \( a_0 \)**  
   Gravitational response becomes non-linear when the local acceleration magnitude satisfies  
   \[
   |g| \sim a_0,
   \]
   where \( a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}} \).

3. **Total-Field Dependence**  
   The effective gravitational response depends on the vector sum of internal and external accelerations:
   \[
   \mathbf{g}_{\text{tot}} = \mathbf{g}_{\text{int}} + \mathbf{g}_{\text{ext}}.
   \]

4. **Spacetime Gradient Saturation**  
   Strong external spacetime gradients suppress the emergence of MOSGM deviations by preventing the system from entering the low-acceleration regime locally.

### 3.3 Mathematical Formulation

Let \( g_N \) denote the Newtonian acceleration generated by the internal baryonic mass distribution \( M_b \).

In MOSGM, the effective gravitational acceleration is written as:
\[
\mathbf{g}_{\text{eff}} = \mathbf{g}_N \, \mathcal{F}\!\left(\frac{|\mathbf{g}_{\text{tot}}|}{a_0}\right),
\]
where:
\[
\mathbf{g}_{\text{tot}} = \mathbf{g}_N + \mathbf{g}_{\text{ext}},
\]
and \( \mathcal{F}(x) \) is a **regime-transition function** with the properties:
\[
\mathcal{F}(x) \rightarrow 1 \quad \text{for} \quad x \gg 1,
\]
\[
\mathcal{F}(x) \rightarrow \frac{1}{x} \quad \text{for} \quad x \ll 1.
\]

Crucially, the transition depends on the **total acceleration magnitude**, not solely on the internal field.

The baryonic threshold radius,
\[
r_t = \sqrt{\frac{G M_b}{a_0}},
\]
marks the location where MOSGM deviations emerge **only if**
\[
|\mathbf{g}_{\text{tot}}(r_t)| \lesssim a_0.
\]

### 3.4 Limiting Cases

#### (i) Isolated System  
If
\[
|\mathbf{g}_{\text{ext}}| \ll |\mathbf{g}_N|,
\]
then:
\[
\mathbf{g}_{\text{tot}} \approx \mathbf{g}_N,
\]
and the system exhibits full MOSGM behavior. Non-Newtonian dynamics emerge near \( r \sim r_t \), producing characteristic deviations such as flat rotation curves or threshold features in velocity dispersion profiles.

---

#### (ii) Weak External Field  
If
\[
|\mathbf{g}_{\text{ext}}| \lesssim a_0,
\]
the MOSGM transition is partially suppressed. Deviations still occur, but with reduced amplitude and spatial extent. This regime is relevant for galaxies in loose groups and cluster outskirts.

---

#### (iii) Strong External Field (Screened Regime)  
If
\[
|\mathbf{g}_{\text{ext}}| \gg a_0,
\]
then:
\[
|\mathbf{g}_{\text{tot}}| \gg a_0 \quad \text{everywhere},
\]
and the system remains effectively Newtonian despite low internal accelerations. In this limit:
- The baryonic threshold radius loses dynamical significance.
- MOSGM deviations are strongly suppressed.
- Dynamics mimic ΛCDM expectations without invoking dark matter.

This regime is expected in dense environments such as galaxy cluster cores.

### 3.5 Contrast with MOND External Field Effect

While both MOND and MOSGM exhibit EFE-like behavior, their physical origins differ fundamentally:

| Aspect | MOND | MOSGM |
|------|------|-------|
| Origin of EFE | Non-linear modification of force law | Emergent spacetime gradient coupling |
| Role of baryons | Source of force | Source of spacetime curvature |
| Threshold radius | Implicit | Explicit: \( r_t = \sqrt{GM_b/a_0} \) |
| Environmental suppression | Empirical feature | Geometric consequence |
| Applicability to clusters | Problematic | Naturally predicts suppression |

In MOND, the EFE is imposed to preserve consistency with Solar System constraints.  
In MOSGM, the EFE follows directly from how spacetime curvature responds to combined baryonic gradients across scales.

### 3.6 Observational Implications

The MOSGM formulation of EFE leads to clear, falsifiable predictions:

- Isolated galaxies exhibit strong non-Newtonian behavior at \( r \sim r_t \).
- Cluster environments suppress MOSGM deviations in proportion to local external field strength.
- Transitional features (e.g., non-analytic changes in velocity dispersion derivatives) appear preferentially in low-external-field systems.

These implications form the basis of the MOSGM-II cluster-scale tests.
