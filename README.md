# MOSGM – Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model

This repository provides a high-level overview of research related to the
Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM), a phenomenological framework
used to formulate testable predictions in astrophysical systems.

Current work focuses on observational tests at galaxy cluster scales, including
statistical analyses of velocity dispersion data and environment-dependent
dynamical behavior.

The analysis code and data-processing pipelines used for active research are
maintained in private repositories and will be released in conjunction with
peer-reviewed publication to ensure reproducibility and clarity.

This public repository is intended for project overview, documentation, and
research context only.
