MOSGM – Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model

This repository provides a concise public overview of research related to the Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM), a phenomenological framework developed to formulate testable and falsifiable predictions in astrophysical systems.

MOSGM research focuses on identifying domain-dependent dynamical behavior in galaxies and galaxy clusters, with particular attention to how localized versus extended baryonic mass distributions give rise to distinct kinematic responses under identical diagnostic conditions.

### Central Prediction (Parameter-free)

\[
r_t = \sqrt{\frac{G M_b}{a_0}}
\]

MOSGM predicts a localized, non-analytic dynamical feature at
\( r \approx r_t \) in velocity-dispersion or rotation-curve
derivatives.  

This feature arises purely from the baryonic mass distribution
and does not rely on dark matter halo modeling or parameter tuning.

Current work emphasizes observational tests using galaxy rotation curves and galaxy cluster velocity-dispersion profiles. The objective is not parameter fitting or curve matching, but the detection or non-detection of pre-registered, scale-specific dynamical features predicted by the framework.

All analysis pipelines, mock tests, and automated verification frameworks used for active research are maintained in private repositories. These materials will be released in conjunction with peer-reviewed publication to ensure reproducibility, clarity, and appropriate scientific context.

This public repository is intended solely for project overview, documentation, and research context. It does not contain analysis code, raw data products, or unpublished figures.
Detailed technical materials are available upon reasonable request.

This repository documents a locked phenomenological framework and completed observational tests of MOSGM at galaxy and cluster scales.

No post-hoc tuning or parameter optimization has been performed after unblinding.
Future extensions (lensing, cosmology) are explicitly out of scope and treated as speculative.

– No curve-fitting or halo modeling
– No unpublished figures or tuned parameters
– No cosmological simulations
– No dark-matter particle assumptions
