MOSGM – Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model

This repository provides a concise public overview of research related to the Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM), a phenomenological framework developed to formulate testable and falsifiable predictions in astrophysical systems.

MOSGM research focuses on identifying domain-dependent dynamical behavior in galaxies and galaxy clusters, with particular attention to how localized versus extended baryonic mass distributions give rise to distinct kinematic responses under identical diagnostic conditions.

Current work emphasizes observational tests using galaxy rotation curves and cluster velocity-dispersion profiles. The objective is not parameter fitting or curve matching, but the detection or non-detection of pre-registered, scale-specific dynamical features predicted by the framework.
